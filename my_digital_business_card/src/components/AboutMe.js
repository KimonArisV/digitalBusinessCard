        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>As a teaching fellow at Harvard, I apply my machine learning expertise and passion to two courses:
        CS109a, an introduction to data science, and CS207, a project-based course on software development for
        computational science. I support the instructors and students in these courses, facilitating learning 
        and fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.

        I hold two bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics from Texas Christian University,
        graduating with honors. I also pursued a master's degree in data science at Harvard University, 
        where I explored advanced topics in deep learning, Bayesian methods, and unsupervised learning. 
        Additionally, during my time as a research associate at Carnegie Mellon University, contributed 
        to the field by publishing practical applications of machine learning to real-world challenges, 
        such as tracking cortical spreading depressions in the brain. I am continually enthusiastic about
        acquiring new skills and knowledge and collaborating with others on data science projects. 
        My ultimate aim is to leverage data science to make a positive impact on society and the 
        environment.</p>
